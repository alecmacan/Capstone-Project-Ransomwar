# Capstone-Project-Ransomwar
Ransomwar is a dynamic malware analysis project I created with my partner Urbano Orozco from our Fullstack Academy Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
We used a Remnux VM with Wireshark and INetSim for our analysis tools.
The two ransomware samples we analyzed are Teslacrypt and Vipasana in hopes to see how they would infect our Windows 7 VM and potentially clash with eachother.
